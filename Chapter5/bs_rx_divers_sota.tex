In literature, the performance of ALOHA-based LPWAN are usually analyzed with Stochastic geometry. Baccelli et al.~\cite{baccelli2006aloha} use Laplace transform for interference analysis for slotted ALOHA. Haenggi et al.~\cite{haenggi2009interference} extensively study the outage probability in SINR-based capture model for slotted ALOHA. B{\l}aszczyszyn et al.~\cite{blaszczyszyn2010stochastic} open the door to study pure ALOHA with stochastic geometry. However, to our best knowledge, macro reception diversity for ALOHA systems has not been studied in literature.
