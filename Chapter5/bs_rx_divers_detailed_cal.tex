\section{Detailed Calculate}
Recall that $r$ is the distance between a node at the origin and the geographically nearest BS. Let $r'$ denote the distance between the considered node and the Best BS. The Best BS refers to the one whose received signal at the device side has the highest SINR.

To make sure that one device can attach to the Best BS, the device measure the received signal from BS for a long time and choose the one minimizing the term in which the term $r' \mathbb{E}\left[ \exp\left( -\frac{1}{\gamma}\chi\right) \right]$. The latter can be regarded as the minimum distance between node and BS. Namely, $r' \mathbb{E}\left[ \exp\left( -\frac{1}{\gamma}\right) \right] =  r $

Given that the PDF of $r$ is defined in Eq.~$\left( \ref{eq:pdf_nearest_distance}\right)$. We obtain the PDF of $r'$ as follows:
\begin{align}
	r' &=  r \mathbb{E}\left[ \exp\left( \frac{1}{\gamma}\right) \right] \\
	F_r'(y) &= \mathbb{P}\left[ r' \leq y \right]  \\
	F_r'(y) &= \mathbb{P}\left[ r \mathbb{E}\left[ \exp\left( \frac{1}{\gamma}\right) \right]  \leq y \right]  \\
	F_r'(y) &= \mathbb{P}\left[ \leq y r \mathbb{E}\left[ \exp\left( -\frac{1}{\gamma}\right) \right]  \right]  \\
\end{align}
