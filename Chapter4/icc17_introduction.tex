\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:icc17-introduction}
Machine-Type Communication (MTC) is expected to gain more popularity in the next decade. Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) networks are regarded to be an attractive option for MTC~\cite{goursaud2015dedicated}. Due to its simplicity, the S-ALOHA (i.e. slotted-ALOHA) protocol is recently regaining interest in Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) handling M2M traffic. 

Despite intensive studies since the birth of S-ALOHA~\cite{abramson1970aloha}, the objectives of the existing related studies are usually analyzing throughput, packet loss rate, etc. In a radio communication system, factors such as capture effect, diversity of transmit power levels, power control precision, among with others, have a significant impact on ALOHA-like multiple access protocol. 

The special features of M2M traffic and requirements highlight the importance of analytical models taking into account performance-affecting factors and giving a thorough performance evaluation.
Fulfilling this necessity is the main focus of this chapter: we jointly consider the impact of capture effect, diversity of transmit power levels with imperfect power control. We propose a low-complexity but still accurate analytical model capable of evaluating S-ALOHA in terms of packet loss rate, throughput, energy-efficiency and average number of transmissions. The proposed model is able to facilitate dimensioning and design of S-ALOHA based LPWAN. The comparison between simulation and analytical results confirms the accuracy of our proposed model. The design guides about S-ALOHA based LPWAN deduced from our model are: the imperfect power control can be positive with capture effect and appropriate transmit power diversity strategy. The transmit power diversity strategy should be determined by jointly considering network charges level, power control precision and SINR threshold to achieve optimal performance of S-ALOHA.

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: Sec.~\ref{sec:icc17-system-model} presents the system model. Sec.~\ref{sec:ideal_power_control} is the performance analysis about S-ALOHA in ideal systems, i.e., without power control and fading. Sec.~\ref{sec:imperfect-power-control} takes into account imperfect power control under wide-band system. Sec.~\ref{sec:simulation_result} proves the accuracy of proposed model by simulation and gives some deduced design guidelines. Sec.~\ref{sec:icc17-conclusion}concludes this chapter.
