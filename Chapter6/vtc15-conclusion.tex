\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this chapter, we analyze the problems posed by MTC traffic handled in current LTE network and propose a network-integrated multiple-period polling service which can be used as enhancement for LTE network to accommodate periodic MTC traffic. The numeric result shows that with our proposal one eNB can support up to $15000$ devices with ease and consume much less system resource than that with random access procedure. In this work, we just consider the radio interface, the effort for reducing signaling overhead in the core network, especially on the S1 interface, can be expected in future work.
